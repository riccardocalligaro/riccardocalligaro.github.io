**PasioneVespa** was built with a modern and efficient web development stack that prioritizes speed, performance, and scalability. The frontend framework, **Next.js**, utilizes TypeScript for type safety and improved development experience. The backend is serverless, using edge functions on **Vercel** to handle API requests and other dynamic operations.

For data persistence, I used a **NeonDB** serverless postgres database, providing a scalable and cost-effective solution for storing and managing website data.

**Cloudflare R2** is used for storing images and other static assets. To optimize image loading performance, WebP images are served whenever possible.

I gathered all the data from a lot of different sources with the help of scraping and other data gathering tools.

I started the project in August of 2023 and deployed it in November.
